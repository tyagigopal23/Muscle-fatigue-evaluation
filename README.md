# Muscle-fatigue-evaluation
A device which measures muscle fatigue using EMG and accelerometer


After the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2021 physical contact among people got minimal and 
everyone avoided the work which required human contact be it Schools, Offices or Gym. 
People started working from home and also, they tried to keep themselves fit during this 
tough time by the means of Home Gyms.
The project incorporates fatigue measurement using EMG and accelerometer which will help a 
user improve their capability to lift heavy weights and save them from muscle injuries 
without any human contact. The implementation of the hardware has been discussed along 
with supporting images and block diagrams.
We here focus on counting the repetition of each exercise with the help of an accelerometer 
and measuring the fatigue using EMG. Furthermore, the scope of work accompanied by its 
application has been appended in the project.
